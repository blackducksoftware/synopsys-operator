# Welcome to Synopsys Community!

## Starting the Application

Buffalo ships with a command that will watch your application and automatically rebuild the Go binary and any assets for you. To do that run the "buffalo dev" command:

	$ buffalo dev

If you point your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) you should see a "Synopsys Operator Console!" page.

**Congratulations!** You now have your Buffalo application up and running.
